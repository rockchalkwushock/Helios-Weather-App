Progressive Web Application built with React & Redux for Weather monitoring.

## WIP
I am currently doing a rewrite of this project to bring it up to speed with the current ecosystems of the tech that was being used; and implement best practices I was not aware of during the building of _v1.0.0_.

If you would like to see what _v1.0.0_ looked like please visit this [branch]().

### TODO _v2.0.0_
- [ ] Test & Build Redux logic of application.
- [ ] Test & Build React Views
- [ ] Implement `flow` type checking.
- [ ] Build simple server for rendering static files `express` or `koa`.
- [ ] Deploy to Zeit.
- [ ] Documentation (internal & external)

### Future Goals
- [ ] Implement ApolloGraphQL.
- [ ] SSR
